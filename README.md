ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Segmentation with Attention U-Net

This project focuses on segmenting breast cancer areas from medical images using a deep learning model called Attention U-Net. The model uses attention gates to help it focus on the most important regions in 
the image, improving accuracy. We trained the model on image-mask pairs, where each mask highlights the cancer area. The model achieved around 95% accuracy on training data and 98% on validation data, with 
clear visual results using predicted masks and Grad-CAM for better understanding.
